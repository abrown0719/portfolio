Muir spent a while here, and at his father’s behest, learned bible from an evangelical group called the Disciples of Christ. Muir would always remain a deeply spiritual man, but eventually his orthodox beliefs left him. By his own words, “…they went away of their own accord…without leaving any consciousness of loss.”"
