    <title>Rounds, Turns, and Actions</title>
    <shortdesc>This is a discussion on what Rounds, Turns, and Actions are.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Combat occurs in rounds, each one taking approximately 10 seconds of game-time. Each
            round, every character gets a turn within the round, where they take actions. Actions
            are things that the characters can do. Every character gets to do a number of actions
            that are equal to their Speed. Actions include things such as running, attacking, or
            using abilities.</p>
        <p>Each round represents about 30 seconds of time in game, though that can be changed
            according to the GMâ€™s wishes. This is important to understand the length of effects, and
            the logical limits to what can be completed within a round.</p>
