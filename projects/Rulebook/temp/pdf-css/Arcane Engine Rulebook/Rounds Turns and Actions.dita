            round, every character gets a turn within the round, where they take actions. Actions
            are things that the characters can do. Every character gets to do a number of actions
            that are equal to their Speed. Actions include things such as running, attacking, or
            using abilities.</p>

            according to the GMâ€™s wishes. This is important to understand the length of effects, and
            the logical limits to what can be completed within a round.</p>
