There are degrees of
                    success and degrees of failure, but an abject failure is very rare, as even in
                    complete disaster, something is often taken away. </p> For GMâ€™s, opposed rolls
                often do not halt the game by their nature, but for standard rolls against a simple
                target, it is important that there not be a binary outcome to the roll. Rolls should
                have a target, but the character falling below the target does not mean that they
                simply fail. Provided is a table with common rolls in comparison to the target, and
                the outcome of those rolls.</div>
