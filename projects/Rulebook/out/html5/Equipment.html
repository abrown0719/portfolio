        <p class="p">Equipment refers to any items that aren't weapons or armor. These items may have some use
            in combat, but the primary use of equipment is not to kill or protect from damage. Many
            items however, can still be used as weapons or armor, but they are not as useful because
            they are not purpose built to do so.</p>
