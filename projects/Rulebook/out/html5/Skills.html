        <p class="p">Skills are an abstraction of a characters trained abilities. While atributes are
            untrained and are innate in the character, skills are gained over time. Skills are
            measured 1-20 like attributes, and without training, each starts at 0. Each skill is
            controlled by an attribute, and this means that a skill cannot go above the number that
            its controlling attribute is. If an attribute is at 10, any skill controlled by that
            attribute cannot go above 10.</p>
