        <p class="p">This may seem like the most cumbersome task in beginning a game, and indeed it is a very
            intensive task, but it is very rewarding to play in a world that you have created,
            especially from the ground up. There are a number of considerations to take into account
            when creating a world, this section shall cover them in moderate detail.</p>
        <p class="p">You, as a world creator want to have an end goal in sight. What kind of world do you want
            to create? Is your world a richly populated world neatly divided into sovereign
            territories, is your world a wild untamed place where humanoids cower in their cities to
            avoid the dangers of the wild? Is your world a place of desolation, where some
            cataclysmic event or series of events has left it mostly in ruin, and your players are
            meant to scrounge for the pieces of a shattered realm?</p>
        <p class="p"> Once you have a general idea of what you want in your world then you must start creating
            rough outlines for things that exist within.</p>

<nav role="navigation" class="related-links"><ul class="ullinks"><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="World%20Creation.html">World Creation</a></strong><br>Here you have to ask yourself a number of broad questions, each of them is meant to         give a better idea of what will be in the world, what wonâ€™t, and how to build it. In         addition, it will give a better idea of what to make when you inevitably have to simulate         history.</li></ul></nav></article></main></body></html>
