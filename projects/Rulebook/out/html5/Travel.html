        <p class="p">Between certain events, much of the time of adventuring and traveling is the actual
            journey itself. Characters may often spend weeks in an airship before they reach their
            target city, and upon another mission are sent to a location three days away. The
            journey itself is just as important as combat.</p>
        <p class="p">GM’s are responsible for pacing a game, and journeys don’t need to be noted or measured
            all the time, but the journey itself can be filled with such rich storytelling that it
            would be a shame to pass up the chance.</p>
        <p class="p">Long Distance Travel is determined by what kind of movement the characters are
            taking.</p>
        <p class="p">For every 2 levels of Athletics a character possesses, they add an extra mile onto their
            daily walking and marching distances.</p>
