        <p class="p">Going beyond the campaign itself to the building blocks that comprise the body of a
            campaign, encounters form the basis of interaction for your players. They do not
            interact with the campaign as a whole, instead, they interact with the individual
            encounters that make up the campaign. The types of encounters generally include
            storytelling encounters, combat encounters, investigative encounters, social encounters,
            explorative encounters, and skill encounters.</p>

There are multitudes of ways that an         encounter can resolve. It is not always a pass/fail objective, in fact oftentimes the         characters will partially succeed at a task and ultimately spawn new problems, and thus new         encounters, for themselves.</li></ul></nav></article></main></body></html>
