        <div class="p">
            <div class="div"><p class="p">There is no success and failure within the strictest sense. There are degrees of
                    success and degrees of failure, but an abject failure is very rare, as even in
                    complete disaster, something is often taken away. </p> For GMâ€™s, opposed rolls
                often do not halt the game by their nature, but for standard rolls against a simple
                target, it is important that there not be a binary outcome to the roll. Rolls should
                have a target, but the character falling below the target does not mean that they
                simply fail. Provided is a table with common rolls in comparison to the target, and
                the outcome of those rolls.</div>
            <div class="div">For opposed checks, the difference to the target refers to difference between the
                players roll and their oppositions roll.</div>
