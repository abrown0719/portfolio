    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This is a basic overview of weapons and armor, what they are, and why they are
        necessary.</p>
        <p class="p">Armor and weapons are those items that specifically deal damage, and protect you from
            damage. As opposed to other equipment that provides tangential bonuses or other effects,
            weapons specifically are used in combat, and armor is worn to protect you from
            damage.</p>
        <p class="p">It is imperative that any character have at least a weapon and some armor in any
            dangerous situation. The world is deadly, and weapons can kill. Your enemies will have
            them, so should you.</p>
