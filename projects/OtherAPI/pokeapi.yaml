    # Welcome!
    Finally; all the Pokémon data you'll ever need, in one place, and easily accessible through a modern RESTful API. This is a full RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series. We have covered everything from Pokémon to Berry Flavors.
    
    ## Introduction
    The Pokemon API aims to provide a single, easily accessible database for all things Pokemon. Pokémon V1 was created by Paul Hallett as a weekend project but it quickly became more than a weekend's worth of work. In December of 2014 Paul deprecated V1 in favor of working on V2.

    This is where Zane Adickes jumped in. Zane thought the original project was a fantastic idea and wanted to help it grow. With direction from Paul, Zane created the V2 api using an exact mirror of Veekun's data related to the main series of games.
    
    ## Overview and Security
    The PokeApi only supports the GET method. 
    
    The Pokemon API does not use any authentication. The information returned by this API is gathered from open sources, so there is no need!
    
    There is a request limit of 300 per day one a single IP address for each endpoint. A single IP address can access more endpoints but no one endpoint can be accessed more than 300 times per IP address in a day. 
    
    Once the 300 request limit has been reached, the server will return a 4XX status in the response header.
    
    If you are going to be using this API a lot, we recommed that cached versions be kept on your service.
    
    ## Fair Use
    PokéAPI is free and open to use. It is also very popular. Because of this, we ask every developer to abide by our fair use policy. People not complying with the fair use policy will have their IP address permenantly banned. Denial of service attacks are not tolerated. This API is an educational tool first and foremost, it is not intended for any use other than education and reference.
    
    We ask that all local resources be cached once they are requested. Please use pagination and don't try to scrape all data at once. Please use the appropriate ***user-agent*** header in requests, and finally just be nice and fair to fello developers in all activities.
    
    The PokeAPI, being open-source,is defined and maintained by the efforts of a collective of volunteers. Please be mindful of the amount of work put into this, and enjoy!
    
    ## Pagination
    The PokeAPI uses pagination whenever an endpoint is called without a resource root. By default, the page will show 20 responses starting at the first entry.
    
    To manipulate this, change the ***limit*** and ***offset*** query parameters. The ***limit*** parameter changes how many resources will be shown on a page, and the ***offset*** parameter defines what resource ID# the list will start at.
    
    For any path with 20 or less resources, or if the ***limit*** is set higher than the total number of resources possible for that endpoint, then all resources will be listed.
    
    Each response body will return with a ***count*** key with a value equal to the total number of resources within that endpoint. Additionally, they will also contain each a ***previous*** and a ***next*** field, with links to the previous and following results pages. If there are no pages, than either or both of those fields will show *null*.

    # Example
    Lets just go through an example.
    
    Say we wanted to look up a berry, but we don't know what berry we want. This is how we'd go about it. We don't want too many results per page, max 5, so we would make the request as such:
    ```json
    $ curl https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/berry?limit=5
    ```
    This will return the following data:
    ```json
    {"count":64,
    "previous":null,
    "results":[{"url":"https:\/\/pokeapi.co\/api\/v2\/berry\/1\/","name":"cheri"},
    {"url":"https:\/\/pokeapi.co\/api\/v2\/berry\/2\/","name":"chesto"},
    {"url":"https:\/\/pokeapi.co\/api\/v2\/berry\/3\/","name":"pecha"},
    {"url":"https:\/\/pokeapi.co\/api\/v2\/berry\/4\/","name":"rawst"},
    {"url":"https:\/\/pokeapi.co\/api\/v2\/berry\/5\/","name":"aspear"}],
    "next":"https:\/\/pokeapi.co\/api\/v2\/berry\/?limit=5&offset=5"}
    ```
    As we can see, there are a total of 64 possible resources within the berry endpoint. There is nothing in ***previous*** because this is the first page, and the ***next*** field has the link to our next page. None of these berries are what we want, so lets go to the next page and make a call using that link. It is offset 5, so it will skip the first five resouces, and begin with resource id 6.
    ```json
    $ curl https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/berry?limit=5&offset=5
    ```
    Which will return the following data:
    ```json
    {"count":64,
    "previous":"https:\/\/pokeapi.co\/api\/v2\/berry\/?limit=5",
    "results":[{"url":"https:\/\/pokeapi.co\/api\/v2\/berry\/6\/","name":"leppa"},
    {"url":"https:\/\/pokeapi.co\/api\/v2\/berry\/7\/","name":"oran"},
    {"url":"https:\/\/pokeapi.co\/api\/v2\/berry\/8\/","name":"persim"},
    {"url":"https:\/\/pokeapi.co\/api\/v2\/berry\/9\/","name":"lum"},
    {"url":"https:\/\/pokeapi.co\/api\/v2\/berry\/10\/","name":"sitrus"}],
    "next":"https:\/\/pokeapi.co\/api\/v2\/berry\/?limit=5&offset=10"}
    ```
    Great, the *persim* berry is what we were looking for. Lets call that. We can call it one of two ways.
    ```json
    $ curl https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/berry/8
    ```
    or
    ```json
    $ curl https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/berry/persim
    ```
    Both methods are valid, and will return the same results.
    
    Great! We've got our data, and we can do with it what we want. Explore the documentation to find all the endpoints, and test out the API. So get started!
