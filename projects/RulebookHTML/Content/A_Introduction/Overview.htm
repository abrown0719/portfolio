            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>This is "The Arcane Engine"; it is a tabletop role-playing game set in the tumultuous industrial revolution. It is a time of great innovation and social upheaval, where fantasy and science fiction blend together. The Arcane Engine is a game of imagination, through which you craft adventures by taking on the role of a character. You are a hero or a villain, a powerful magician, a brilliant technologist, an ultra-skilled warrior. Whatever you wish to be, you are destined for greatness. The world awaits your brilliance, so go forth!</p><br>
            <p>The game itself is a science-fiction, fantasy game limited only by your imagination.There are no computer programs to run, no world boundaries on pre-made map models, no doors that cannot be opened, no boxes that cannot be smashed, no person that will not speak, no limit that cannot be reached. You and your friends merely get around a table, take your characters, your keys to the world, and play the game as if you were in it yourselves. Players are heavily encouraged to get into characters as much as possible, if only to enrich the experience for everyone playing.</p><br>
            <p>There is, however, some method to this reality. Like nearly all tabletop games, there are players, and a game referee, or Game Master (GM). The GM is a single person, who takes on the arduous job of managing the world, the monsters, the nonplayer characters (NPC’s), the story, and all other facets that facilitate a space with which Players can interact. The Players Themselves merely control a single, special, character within the world set up by the Game Master. Think of the GM and Players as two parts to a book, with the GM being the writer, and the Players being the main characters. The key difference being that the main characters of the story are acting of their own accord, and the GM merely has control over everything else.</p><br>
            <p>This Core Rulebook contains all necessary information for designing and playing a game of The Arcane Engine. From beginning the design of a character, figuring out their stats and skills, giving them life and depth, and entering them into the world. The core rulebook also contains a couple of quick encounters with which players and GM’s can get a feel for the game, a small list of possible monsters and enemies, a complete list of currently created magic spells, specialist classes, and technological items, and a section of good GM tactics and helpful hints for running a game.</p><br>
            <h2>Playing the Game</h2><br>
            <p>This game is a game of tactics, strategy, roleplaying, acting, and storytelling. It is most recommended to use a grid and miniatures, as these aid in the description of a setting and especially in the tactics of play. These miniatures represent your characters, and they can be anything, from a 3-D printed model you made with detail down to the buckle on her belt, a square cutout with a name on it, or a marble that had an interesting color. These are hardly necessary though, and many players always opt to not use one, instead playing in a “theater of the mind” which allows for quicker gameplay and a more cinematic experience.
            </p><br>
            <p>As a character you will face tasks. This is a loose term to describe situations which you must overcome. To simulate the often unseen circumstances of real life that many cannot track but dictate how any task will resolve, this game uses dice. The Core Mechanic of this game is to roll a 20 sided die (d20) whenever you are faced with a task and must take action. Your roll on the die is added to whatever modifiers that exist, such as your skill at the task, and compared against a number called a Target. This target number represents how difficult the task is, the higher the number, the more difficult the task. Depending upon how close you come to the number, under or over, shows how well you succeed, or how badly you fail at the task.</p><br>
            <p>This system is designed to only need a single die, a single d20 to roll for all things. There are no other dice needed for anyone except the GM, who needs only 2 6-sided die. Other things will be needed will be this ruleset, a character sheet provided in the book, and scrap paper. The use of a battle grid and miniatures is optional.</p><br>
            <p>Remember, this system is a game of imagination. There is no limit to what your characters can do. Describe what you want to do, and talk to the GM about whether what you wish is possible, and what happens because of it. Your character has a plethora of numbers: Attributes, skills, abilities, and knowledge fields, to figure out if and how they can do something. These are rolled using the core mechanic to accomplish tasks in the world.</p><br>
            <p>This Core Rulebook should be used to create and manage characters, create and manage worlds, and give ideas and tools to craft stories. This core rulebook does not contain an exhaustive list of possible plot points and does not set hard rules about abilities. You are free to ignore or expand upon parts of this book at your leisure to suit your game.</p><br>
