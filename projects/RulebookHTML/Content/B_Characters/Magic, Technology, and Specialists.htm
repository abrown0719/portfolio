            <h1>Magic, Technology, and Specialists</h1>
            <h2>Magic</h2>
            <p>The following is a discussion on magic in the game, and what it means beyond the numbers. The power of a mage comes from their natural energy or fatigue. Casting spells constantly is very draining, and becomes even more acutely tiring as you unlock more powerful abilities. A powerful mage may have stronger spells than a weaker mage, but it also becomes much more difficult to cast those spells, and with increased power comes increased responsibility to both yourself and the world. Your power may eventually become powerful enough to destroy whole towns and level battlefields in an instant; these powers are for you to choose how to act, but let it be known that there will always be those who fear your power and abilities, those who wish to control your natural abilities, and those who hate your gifts and will stop at nothing to destroy them in whatever way possible.
            <br>
            Magic is intrinsically personal to the mage, and often reflects and/or directly affects their personality. This is one of the many differences between magic and technology, which is often quite detached from the personality of the technologist. Magic, especially high powered magic, leaves scars and traces in the world. Magic or the energy that allows mages to use magic, is little understood, but is oftentimes referred to as the essence of reality. By working magic, a mage is bending and tearing at reality in a fundamental way.
            <br>
            There are 15 distinct magical classes, each commanding a separate array of powers. Oftentimes these classes overlap in usage, some are meant to deal damage, some are meant to heal and support, and some contain defensive capabilities, some utilitarian uses, and most combine two or three of these.
            <br>
            <h3>Casting Magic</h3>
            <p>Magic works the same way as any roll, but it does require a few extra steps. It will come down to a dice roll however.
                <br>
                1. Choose the spell that the player wishes to cast.<br>
                2. Determine the effect of the spell with the GM.<br>
                3. Determine how much the spell is going to cost to cast it, either in materials or in fatigue.<br>
                4. Determine the target of the spell, if applicable.<br>
                5. Determine how the target will resist the spell, if applicable.<br>
                6. Roll: The player rolls their Spell Power, and the opponent rolls their resistance in an opposed check.<br>
                7. Determine effect as a normal opposed roll. If the player wins, the spell affects the enemy, if the enemy wins, the spell
                does nothing.</p><br>
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p> This section is a discussion on technology in the world. Technologists create machinery from nothing, seeming to control the worldâ€™s powers with nothing more than a heap of scrap metal and some good ingenuity. Technologists have an array of different inventions on them which they can use to boost themselves, harness lightning to throw it at enemies, entrap them and destroy them with explosives and so much more! The life of a technologist is what you make of it, and the rewarding nature of invention provides a rich life full of challenges that test both your physical and mental prowess.
            <br>
            Unlike magic, technology and its disciplines are not inherently tied to the personality of whoever studies them. That in itself is one of the greatest strength of modern science and technology, there is such a diversity of opinions and ideas, and the best and brightest rise quickly to the top!
            <br>
            There are eight distinct Technological classes, each with a very distinct set of schematics, and each with its own general usage. Oftentimes these classes overlap in their usage though, and most classes contain schematics that require creations from other classes, and likewise they contain items that are used as reagents for other creations in other classes.
            </p>
            <h3>Using Technology</h3>
            <p>This is the way in which technological items are created.<br>
                1. Determine the item that the player wants to make.<br>
                2. Determine the effect of this item.<br>
                3. Determine how difficult it will be to make, and required materials, and any complications.<br>
                4. Roll: The player rolls their Creation Expertise as a standard test.<br>
                5. Determine the result: If the result is higher than the number set by the GM in step 3, the item is created, if it is not, the
                process fails, and the item is lost.</p>
            <h2>Specialists</h2>
            <p>
                There is little to be said about the special aspects and quirks of being a specialist. These men and women fill the necessary gaps left by those who devote themselves to technology, magic, or more mundane life. The name specialist is not meant to be specific; it is not a title that one would give them. It is a name to differentiate them from technologists or mages, and to enhance the fact that these people have perfected an art, just as difficult as any technology or magic class. These people can be anyone and can come from all walks of life. There is often a reason why someone would choose a particular specialist class, and the class that one chooses is often tied to their background. Specialist classes are used to represent years of hard training and focus funneled into a specific set of skills. It does not often give special powers that defy the laws of reality or allow the creation of incredibly complex machines or drugs. Instead, it enhances a set of skills with special passive and some active abilities that would only come to one who specifically dedicates time in their life to honing these skills.
            <br>
                There are 13 distinct Specialist Classes, each with a very distinct set of abilities, and each with its own general usage. These classes rarely overlap, each one focuses on a specific set of skills, and though some of them might have similar abilities, each has a very narrow focus.
