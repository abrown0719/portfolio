            <h1>What are Characters?</h1>
            <p>This section describes the broad concept of a character and their place.
                A character is a person that exists within the game world for the purpose of a player to play them. A player’s key, their portal
                into the world, is their character, and it is the one true thing that the player has control over. Characters are simply people
                within the game world, and they should act and be treated as such.
                To a GM, the characters are paramount insofar as they are the stories’ protagonists. The GM is never to make the story not
                about the main characters, and though the main characters face hardship, they might be outmatched constantly, and they may
                not be the great hero of all time, they are the main characters.</p>
                <h2>
                    What makes a Character?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A quick overview of what makes a character what they are, and what they are defined by.
A character is a collection of numbers that describe themselves, combined with the story of their life and personality. Neither
the numbers, nor the story are meaningful without the other when it comes to playing the game.
A character is defined by what is on their character sheet, which is supposed to be a direct-but-symbolic translation of their
physical and mental being into numbers and words. Their attributes define their physical and mental faculties as raw power and
unharnessed energy, their skills show this being put into practical use, and define their proficiency at doing things in the world,
and their abilities translate their specialness and extraordinary capabilities into a tangible asset that can be used in the game
world. Their equipment represents all the stuff they should have on them, their knowledge fields represent their mental store of
information, and their Goals, Habits, and Facets, reduce a complex personality into an easily digestible format for the players
and the GM to understand.
