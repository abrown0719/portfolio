            <h1>Goals,Habits,Facets</h1>
            <p>This is a section that describes the less mechanical aspects of a character to round out personality. Goals, Habits, and Facets are meant to round out a characters personality. There are no set values for these, and they are inherently intimate to a character and a player. They are also individual to every character.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Goals</b>: Goals are simply things that the character wants to do, life goals, temporary goals, anything that the character believes should be done. These can be anything from a simple goal to find your brother, to something as grandiose as dethroning the king. Characters are encouraged to pick three of these that are meaningful and can get the player into interesting and dangerous situations.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Habits</b>: Habits are things that your character does reflexively. “I scream when startled.” These may not be apparent to work against or for you immediately, but perhaps you scream loudly at a fancy dinner because the waiter brushed your back…that can be interesting.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Facets</b>: Facets are things about your character that stand out, and are memorable. “Hairy,” “Hot-headed,” or “Clumsy,” things that people will remember you by. Again, these things might endear you to someone or antagonize others, and either way, it builds the story and tension.
