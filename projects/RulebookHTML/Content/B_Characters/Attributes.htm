            <h1>Attributes</h1>
            <p>An attribute is a number that represents something innate about a characters physicality or mental capabilities. Attributes are untrained talents. An attribute does not describe how good a character is at doing any one task, and attributes apply to a lot of tasks. Derived Attributes are secondary attributes that describe things that are innate, but not a core attribute. They are derived, because their values are derived from math applied to the regular 8 attributes.</p>
            <p>Strength:
                Strength is a measure of your characters muscle and physical power and prowess. This attribute is important for any character that wishes to focus in melee combat, but also serves important roles for other characters.
            </p>
            <p>Dexterity:
                Dexterity is the main attribute to determine the coordination and agility of characters. It is directly a measure not only of how deft the character is with their appendages, but their ability to contort themselves and their ability to move quickly.
            </p>
            <p>Constitution:
                Constitution is the measure of your characters’ physical hardiness and stamina. Constitution directly contributes to physical resistance and to the fatigue pool.
            </p>
            <p>Perception:
                Perception is a measure of your characters acute awareness of the surrounding area and their attention to detail.
            </p>
            <p>Intelligence:
                Intelligence is the measure of a person’s ability to think and create sound conclusions to problems. Intelligence is also a measure of a person’s memory and is often rolled to recall specific things that wouldn’t pertain to a knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>Willpower:
                The willpower of a character determines their mental hardiness and stamina, their determination, as well as their acute attention to themselves.
            </p>
            <p>Charisma:
                Charisma is the measure of a characters force of personality, drive, personal magnetism, leadership capabilities and ability to press their mind onto others.
            </p>
            <p>Beauty:
                Beauty is the measure of a characters physical attractiveness. This can mean multiple things, from the attractiveness or look of their skin and physical shape, to their smell, and even their clothes.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Derived Attributes</h2>
            <p>This is a list of derived attributes, what they are, and how they are derived.</p>
            <p>Physical Resistance=Strength + Constitution divided by 2.<br>
                Your physical resistance is a blanket attribute to describe your ability to resist a multitude of various attacks. Anything from poison, electricity, to great forces that attempt to knock you down roll against your physical resistance.
                </p>
            <p>Mental Resistance=Willpower + Intelligence divided by 2.<br>
                Your mental resistance is a blanket attribute to describe your ability to resist any type of assault on your mind or psyche. Anything from mental magic, to mind affecting gadgets and even persuasion techniques that attempt to lull you into some non-natural state. In addition, this is used to roll against any type of fear or mental trauma.
                </p>
            <p>Damage Resistance=(Strength divided by 2) + any bonuses from
                armor.<br>
                Damage resistance is your ability to slough off damage dealt directly to your body.
                </p>
            <p>Creation Expertise=Dexterity + Intelligence divided by 2.<br>
                Creation expertise is your ability as a technologist, to create things that are of higher quality.
                </p>
            <p>Spell Power=Willpower + Charisma divided by 2.<br>
                Spell power is a derived attribute that determines how powerful your spells are.
                </p>
            <p>Speed=Dexterity + Perception divided b 2.<br>
                This is how fast your character moves, and how many times they may act in battle. Faster characters gain more actions and can move further.
                </p>
            <p>Health=(Strength multiplied by 5) + 100.<br>
                Health is a numerical abstraction of a persons ability to cling to life. The lower the number, the closer they are to death.
                </p>
            <p>Fatigue=(Constitution multiplied by 5) + 100.<br>
                Fatigue is a numerical measure of a persons energy level. As the number falls, the character becomes more and more tired, until finally falling unconscious or becoming unable to act due to exhaustion.
