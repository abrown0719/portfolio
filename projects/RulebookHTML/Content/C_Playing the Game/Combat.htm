            <h1>Combat</h1>
            <p>
                Combat is the basis of interaction, and underlies all higher diplomatic exchanges from the individual to the international. In
                this world, there are rules that outline how to translate real world combat to the table.<br>
                Note through all of this that combat in The Arcane Engine is not meant to be simulation-like or hyper-realistic. There are
                plenty of RPG systems that wish to translate hyper-realism. The Arcane Engine wishes to translate a heroic combat system
                that simplifies combat in a way that enables players to engage in stylish combat with dangerous enemies while keeping a very
                deadly and dangerous atmosphere in which players will need to utilize their full arsenal and work together to succeed.
                Combat in The Arcane Engine is cyclical, with everyone going in turn following a standard combat sequence. This, of course,
                is not literally supposed to be imagined as people waiting for another to make an action before they take their turn, everything
                is happening simultaneously. Each character has a number of actions to take per turn, and takes them on their turn.
                To assist the GM and characters in maintaining a collective imaginative space, and ensure that the players understand events in
                the game, a game grid can be used. Game grids and miniature figures or markers allow the table to physically show character
                positions and range for abilities, attacks, and movement. There may not be much use for a game grid when doing normal
                adventuring, but during battle it is invaluable.</p>
            <h2>Rounds, Turns, and Actions</h2>
                <p>
                Combat occurs in rounds, each one taking approximately 10 seconds of game-time. Each round, every character gets a turn
                within the round, where they take actions. Actions are things that the characters can do. Every character gets to do a number
                of actions that are equal to their Speed. Actions include things such as running, attacking, or using abilities.
                Each round represents about 30 seconds of time in game, though that can be changed according to the GMâ€™s wishes. This is
                important to understand the length of effects, and the logical limits to what can be completed within a round.</p>
            <h2>The Attack Roll</h2>
                <p>
                An attack roll represents your attempt to strike your opponent on your turn in a round. When you make an attack roll, you roll
                a d20 and add your appropriate combat skill. (Other modifiers may also apply to this roll.) The enemy rolls a d20 and adds
                their Dodge skill (Or other appropriate skills like Small/Large Melee if parrying) against Physical Damage, their Physical
                Resistance against Elemental Damage, or Mental Resistance against Mental or Enchantment Damage. If the attacker rolls
                higher than the defender the attack succeeds and deals damage, if the defender rolls higher than the attacker, the attack fails
                and does not deal damage. If the difference between the attack and defend rolls are 5 or more, then extra effects may happen.</p>
            <h2>Damage, Injury, and Death</h2>
                <p>
                Getting damaged happens when a character does not completely dodge out of the way of an attack. Taking hits is never good,
                as every hit reduces the HP of the character, which may end in death. There are ways to reduce the damage a character takes
                however, including high skills for defense, and high damage resistance from armor, which can make a character immune to
                low damage attacks. <br>
                Damage Resistance is the armor, both natural and non-natural of a character. Damage Resistance is naturally half of your
                STR. Beyond that, any armor the character wears will add more to Damage Resistance. The DR of all specific types of
                armor will be detailed later in the book. Damage Resistance is removed from damage directly. A 20 damage attack against a
                character with 20 DR does no damage.<br>
                Health Points mean two things in the game world: the ability to take physical punishment and keep going, and the ability
                to turn a serious blow into a less serious one. Likewise Fatigue represents your inability to maintain composure and
                consciousness under intense pain and blood loss, as well as exhaustion from exerting yourself in extraordinary ways.
                It is assumed that until a character hits 0 HP, they have not taken any massive wounds that would stop them through their
                adrenaline. Upon hitting 0 HP, the character takes a massive disabling wound, and could possibly end in instant death.
                Likewise, it is assumed that adrenaline keeps a character acting as normal until FT hits 0. Upon a character hitting 0 FT, the
                characters adrenaline fails them, and their battle fatigue catches up, forcing them to take a quick breather.</p>
            <h2>Initiative</h2>
                <p>Initiative is the order in which individuals act in a structured time frame. It determines who goes first in a combat scenario.
                Initiative is simply a series of standard rolls using the initiative attribute. <br>
                1. Everyone rolls a simple task, adding Initiative to the roll. <br>
                2. Compare all results and order them highest to lowest. <br>
                3. Resolve all actions according to the list in order.</p>
