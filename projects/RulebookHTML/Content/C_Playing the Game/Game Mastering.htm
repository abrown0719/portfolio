            <h1>Game Mastering</h1>
            
            <p>World Creation
                Here you have to ask yourself a number of broad questions, each of them is meant to give a better idea of what will be in the
                world, what won’t, and how to build it. In addition, it will give a better idea of what to make when you inevitably have to
                simulate history.<br>
                1. How old is my world?: Remember that the world must be old enough for the story to take place. Planets are not formed
                in days, they are formed over eons of time. Billions of years for the process of rock formation and volcanic activity to
                give way to basic life forms which evolve in complexity over many millions upon millions of years until humanoids
                evolve. Then of course, humanoid civilization takes many thousands, if not millions of years to evolve in complexity,
                as many start out as tribal hunter-gatherers, slowly settling down into sedentary lifestyles, and developing culture,
                language, and technology. To give you an idea, as of the year 2015, the Earth is roughly 4.5 Billion years old, and
                modern humans have only existed for about 200,000-1 million years, which is relatively short.<br>
                2. How developed is my world?: This gets more into the people and civilizations of your world. By nature of playing
                The Arcane Engine, it necessitates a number of assumptions about the technological level of your world, but that
                doesn’t mean that socio-cultural development has kept pace, nor does it mean that all this technology affords
                humanoids dominance over the natural world. How much of the planet’s surface could be considered, “civilized”? Is
                the whole world within the reach of one or another sprawling empire, or is the world still wild, with pockets of capable
                civilizations?<br>
                3. How wild is my world?: If you choose to have a wild world where humanoids cannot dominate the landscape, what is
                stopping them? Surely with massive machines, guns, explosives, magic, etc. Humanoids could rule the landscape? This
                question can have many answers, such as a dearth of resources, of course no one can build that many machines if iron
                deposits are rare. Perhaps the landscape is filled with deadly monsters that can tear full grown ogres limb from limb, and
                to whom bullets are a mere annoyance. Perhaps the landscape is so filled with war, and the kingdoms of humanoids are
                so distrusting of each other that populations never reach levels high enough to tame the landscape.<br>
                4. How rich is my world?: This question flows naturally out of the last one, and doesn’t refer to money, as money is
                an invention. How much of any and all natural resources are on your world? If gold is everywhere it won’t become a
                commodity, because everyone has it. If Iron is extremely rare, then war is harder to wage as weapons are harder to make,
                and iron mines are national treasures. In addition, in such a world, any scrap metal left over from destroyed machines
                would be scrounged up immediately and sold quickly. A world mired in war must have a rich stock of resources to fuel
                those wars.<br>
                5. How old is civilization?: When did humanoids start to develop complex cultural civilizations? An easy marker to begin
                with is the widespread development of agriculture. Sedentary lifestyle was based around the demands of farming, and
                farming was adopted as a way to easily and efficiently make food. Deliberate cultivation and animal domestication
                began on earth somewhere between 10,000-13,000 years ago. Though it is common to include some cataclysmic event
                that reset civilization and extends the development time of humanoid civilization to the current date within your game.<br>
                6. Where did civilization begin? How did it spread?: Generally, the first signs of agricultural development will be in
                very fertile areas where crops are easy to grow. On Earth, farming began in the Fertile Crescent, an area that enveloped
                the ancient lands of Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, and Egypt. These areas are today Egypt, Israel, Iraq, Iran, and their
                surrounding nations. This is important because where civilization began, characters will find the oldest ruins, and
                possibly some of the strangest remains…perhaps ancient magic? In addition, this allows for the development of larger
                and more established civilizations, as technology and culture will flow from already established cultures to new lands
where they will be adopted by less advanced people.<br>
7. Where are resources most plentiful?: Simply put, the land with the most resources will end up becoming the most
powerful nation. Though often, certain lands are rich in certain resources, while others are rich in different resources. If
gold is rare, then a country with massive gold deposits will be rich, and are in a good position to become trade masters.
The country with the most fertile land will have a higher population, and of course that means larger cities, and larger
armies. The land with the most iron will have more iron items, and will be able to field better equipped armies, as they
have the materials for good armor and weapons without having to import them.<br>
8. How many states exist in this world? Are they peaceful or not?: This is simple, if you want to have a lot of kingdoms
in your world, they will be smaller and there will probably be more war. On the other hand, larger kingdoms, and
empires, will often also have war, but the scale will be much larger and more widespread.<br>
9. How much magic exists in this world?: Magic is a part of this system, a very integral part. So how much magic exists
in the world? Is technology much more common, or is there magic to go around constantly? Does everyone have access
to it, or is it expensive and hereditary? Magic will also shape culture, and often has an effect on the distribution and
development of kingdoms. Be mindful of all this.</p>
<h2>Adventures and Campaigns</h2>            
<p>Adventures, or campaigns, are strings of scenarios and encounters put together by an overarching story, which includes a
                consistent cast of characters. Adventures are incredibly rewarding and interesting, because it allows players to see characters
                develop over a longer period of time, and see a story through a satisfying end.
                GM’s should communicate what type of campaign they would like to play to their players. If the campaign is to be structured,
                then the GM should make their campaign after the players make their characters, so as to build the campaign in a way that
                incorporates each players’ character seamlessly.
                For Game Masters, designing an adventure can take a long time, and it is good to get collaboration from your players in what
                campaign to run.</p><br>
            <p>A Problem That Needs Solving:
                There must be something to overcome, a specific reason why the party would go forth and do what they are doing. This
                can be as simple as a singular assassination contract, or a multiple part, world-wide treasure hunt. The problem may
                simply be that the party wants an item and will do whatever is needed to obtain that item. The problem must however be
                worthy of their attention and valuable to them in some way, even if it’s only valuable to give to someone else.<br>
                A Clear Goal:
                Characters must have a clear goal to work towards. In a structured campaign, this is very easy to set up, and the goal
                is ever-present. In a free form campaign, this means that the characters must always have something to do. It is not
                necessarily something they should or will do, but merely something that they can do.<br>
                Meaningful Outcomes for
                Everyone:
                This means two things: That the players should have choices that actually matter to the outcome of the story, and that
                there should be choices that everyone can participate in.<br>
                Interesting Encounters:
                Encounters, which are covered later, are the basis of what a campaign is identified by. In essence, a campaign is a
                series of encounters. Each of these encounters should be interesting and meaningful. Having filler fights for the sake
                of fighting is not a good way to go about it. Players should feel like every encounter, whether social or martial, has a
                meaning. Do not just randomly set enemies upon your players, with no outcomes for winning beyond experience and
                loot. The enemies should have a purpose to be there. This is not to say that random encounters are not good, but just
                that random encounters for the sake of randomness is not good. If the players are attempting to fight through a docks
                district to catch a VIP, then random henchmen or bodyguards popping up to fight the players is meaningful. They are not
                just there to fight the players, they are there to defend the VIP. Even if the enemies are there just to weaken the players
                and expend valuable items before the players fight some monster at the end of a tunnel system is meaningful, even
                though it may not appear so.</p><br>
            <h2>Encounters</h2>
                <p>Going beyond the campaign itself to the building blocks that comprise the body of a campaign, encounters form the basis
                of interaction for your players. They do not interact with the campaign as a whole, instead, they interact with the individual encounters that make up the campaign. The types of encounters generally include storytelling encounters, combat encounters,
                investigative encounters, social encounters, explorative encounters, and skill encounters.</p><br>
            <p>Clear Goal:
                A GM must have a clear goal for an encounter. There should never be encounters where nothing is
                accomplished. Of course, the GM should not attempt to force their ideal resolution to an encounter that would
                be railroading. The point is to make the encounter meaningful. Combat not just for the sake of combat, but to
                do something beyond, to symbolize a purpose or forward an agenda. A social encounter should never end with
                an awkward silence and no progress; ending the social encounter having made a bitter enemy of the players is
                still progress, and possible plot points later on.<br>
                Interesting Developments:
                Simply put, an encounter should have some interesting developments made so that the players actually feel
                invested in the outcome. Players should never feel like the encounter they ended was completely frivolous
                and pointless. It is up the GM to specially craft encounter so as to make them interesting, and with interesting
                outcomes. Encountering the barbarian tribe should make the players excited or nervous, because the
                barbarians should pose a significant threat while the players finish another objective in the area. Talking
                with the local lord should give the players a mission that is both interesting and challenging. For a group of
                master level mages and weapon experts, a den of overgrown rats is hardly challenging or interesting. An evil
                cult attempting to raise a demon is much more interesting, mostly because it actually poses a challenge to
                the players’ abilities. Players like to see their characters constantly grow and overcome greater and greater
                challenges, so give them such.<br>
                Fun for Everyone:
                An encounter should be fun for everyone involved. Again, this goes back to the fact that the players should be
                challenged, but the players should also actually be having fun. A slugfest against equally matched opponents
                is challenging, but hardly fun. The players should be given opportunities to show their tactical prowess and
                critical thinking skills, and rewarded with bonuses that affect their dice rolls. Social encounters should not just
                be a simple roll vs another roll. There should be preparation and intrigue invested into the final conversation.</p><br>
            <h2>Non-Player Characters</h2>
                <p>Enemies and Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are an incredibly important aspect of being a GM, and can quite possibly be the
                    most difficult things to create and manage. NPC is a general term that refers to everyone else in the game world that is not
                    actively controlled by one of the players at the game table. Every enemy, every shopkeeper, every civilian, and every critter
                    that the players meet is an NPC, and is under the complete control of the GM. The players control their characters, and the GM
                    quite literally plays as the rest of the world.</p><br>
            <p>NPCs are not Player Characters:
                The Player Characters are the center of the story. The players are your reason why this campaign is
                happening, so you as the GM must understand that your part is to play the less important world around
                them. Now this is not to say that anything that happens to anyone else isn’t as important within the game
                world, but outside the game world, everyone else is, in fact, less important. NPCs should almost never
                become the focus of your story, and if they must, they should not be able to drive the plot forward without
                the aid of the player characters.<br>
                NPCs are People Too:
                Just because NPCs are not as important as the players doesn’t mean they aren’t supposed to be living
                thinking beings as well. They have emotions, they make mistakes, they are not all knowing, and they
                don’t usually want to die. NPCs should react accordingly when the players do something. Even if the
                NPC would severely complicate the lives of the Players, such as calling the police when the Players are
                spotted committing a crime, that NPC should do so. It is what the NPC would do naturally.<br>
                The GM is not the NPC:
                As a GM, you must understand above and beyond your players the necessity of separating in-game and
                out-of-game knowledge. You as the GM understand what is going to happen in a few moments. You
                know when the wolves are going to attack, and when the police are going to arrive. The NPC you are
                playing as may not know these things. In combat, enemies are not perfectly coordinated unless they
                have some sort of mental link. They often do not perform 4-part combos unless they happen to be some
                special task-force that have worked together before.</p><br>
            
            <h2>Guidelines</h2>
                <p>Know the Rules:
                    GM’s are meant to be the rules keeper, and the arbiter of the game. The players will constantly ask you if anything
                    they are doing is ok to do, and if they can do something within the game. More importantly, they will ask you how to
                    do something, so having the rules ready both in your mind and in text are essential to being a good GM.<br>
                    
                    Know How to Break the Rules:
                    If the rules are too stringent for your tastes, or the rules are not correct in your mind or the mind of your players, you
                    must be a good improviser in making up other rules for the situation. This is especially important in places where there
                    is no specific rule. This book is not meant to be a replete composition of all possible scenarios and all possible rules.
                    In addition, if you make a new rule, you must be consistent with them. Players want to have a consistent set of rules so
                    they know what game they are playing.<br>
                    
                    You are the Game Master: “Master” of the Game:
                    You are the master of the game, the story teller, the guide. The players may object to some of your decisions, and they
                    may very well believe that your judgments are not right, but they, and you, must understand that the GM’s rulings are
                    final. Later on, you may come to find your old judgments are, in fact, wrong, and you can change them (Make sure to
                    apologize).<br>
                    
                    The Players are Not the Enemy:
                    If a Player does something you do not like, or if you feel that the players are doing too well and need challenging,
                    you must remember that the players are your friends, and collaborative storytellers. Often, GMs will see that they are
                    constantly playing the villain attempting to best the Player Characters, and will extrapolate that outside of the game
                    world. They will believe that the GM himself is supposed to best the Players at the table. So they will throw all manner
                    of horrible obstacles at the players, thinking this time they have them dead to rights. The Players come out on top, and
                    the GM just gets more frustrated, and schemes further. Take a step back, and realize that fighting your players leads
                    to bitterness, and a completely un-fun experience for everyone. Seeing the Players overcome a meaningful challenge
                    should provide you with the satisfaction you need. If you don’t derive satisfaction from helping other people succeed,
                    then being a GM may not be for you.<br>
                    
                    What Happens in Game, Stays in Game:
                    If a problem happens in game, it must stay within the game, and though players may be prone to bringing quarrels
                    outside of the game world, you as the GM should help them to cool off, and bring it back to reality. Romantic
                    relationships in the game do not mean anything outside of it, and arguments within the game should never cause the
                    players to actually get angry at each other.
                    In addition, things that happen outside the game should never make it into the game world. You and your players are
                    playing this game to simulate a separate reality from the world you live in. Thusly, your real-world problems should
                    not become in-game vendettas. If you dislike something someone did that day, their character should never suffer for
                    it.<br>
                    
                    Let Go of Your Creations:
                    Just because you created something does not mean that it means the same thing to the players. The immense effort
                    you put into building a storyline might be all for naught as the players kill the NPC that would introduce them to said
                    storyline. It is better for yourself and for everyone else if you calm down, and let go of things you hold dear. It is
                    sometimes physically painful to see a well-built villain die in a single round of combat due to three critical hits, but
                    that is life, and neither the dice, nor your players, hate you.<br>
                    
                    Let the Players Help You:
                    Sometimes the work of creating the world can get overwhelming, this is completely understandable. It is always
                    recommended to let the players help in designing the world, especially if something they create is relatively
                    inconsequential outside of itself. Perhaps Player A has come from a small town not on the map. Alright, let him create
                    that town, and let him flesh it out. This adds to your world, it takes work away from you, and it gives your player
                    a wonderful sense of attachment to the world. In addition, remember that your players will feel attached to their
                    characters. These characters are the players’ insertion into the world, their creative sandbox. So let them do whatever
                    they want with their characters, within reason of course. A consequence of this is, be very careful taking control away from the players. This includes all types of mind control or action control. If your players no longer have their
                    characters, they have nothing…and if they have nothing, they have no reason to be at the table.<br>
                    
                    Have Fun with It:
                    This is a game, so have some fun! Your role as a GM was never mandated by anyone, and you are probably not being
                    paid to be a GM. It can feel like a job at times, and the players may never know the work you put into the game, but
                    that isn’t important. What is important is that you and your players have fun with the game. So enjoy yourself, and
                    enjoy the amazing collaborative experience that Tabletop RPGs can bring.</p>
