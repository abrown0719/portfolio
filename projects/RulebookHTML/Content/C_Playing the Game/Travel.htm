            <h1>Travel</h1>
            <p>
            Travel and adventure is important to the game. In between moments of action, every other things falls into traveling and adventure. Most things within adventure and travel scenarios are simple checks. They do not have to be resolved by paying attention to time. This is the time to challenge all the skills that aren't necessary for combat, and to include things like debates and mysteries.
            </p>
            <p>
            Between certain events, much of the time of adventuring and traveling is the actual journey itself. Characters may often spend weeks in an airship before they reach their target city, and upon another mission are sent to a location three days away. The journey itself is just as important as combat. GM’s are responsible for pacing a game, and journeys don’t require to be noted or measured all the time. The journey itself can be filled with such rich storytelling that it would be a shame to pass up the chance. Long Distance Travel is determined by what kind of movement the characters are taking. For every two levels of Athletics, a character possesses, they add an extra mile onto their daily walking and marching distances.
            </p>
            <h2>Treasure and Rewards</h2>
            <p>
            As characters complete missions and adventure around, characters will frequently discover themselves with a lot of money and treasures. These treasures are often in the form of money, but will often be rare treasures and old items. It is recommended that players come up quickly with a method for divvying up loot and treasures. Oftentimes an effective way to divvy up loot is to split it evenly. If someone wants a specific item, then perhaps that lowers their share of the rest of the treasure. Perhaps that item is so valuable it is their entire share, or perhaps they obtain that item simply because they can utilize it. Rewards can come in other forms of course, including followers and henchmen, reputation, honors and medals, titles and property. The critical thing about rewards is they are meaningful. GM’s do not want to force players on an extended and difficult mission only to offer them a meaningless reward. That does not make a good gaming experience.
            </p>
            <h2>Chase and Pursuits</h2>
            <p>
            This is a discussion on chases and pursuits. Chasing opponents or objects refers to the short-term, quick act of going after a target. This target could be a person, especially an enemy the players want to catch and/or kill. It could be an object like a piece of paper flying in the wind or a runaway cart, a skittish horse, any many more. Chasing is simple, and will involve both Athletics and Acrobatics checks, with possibly other checks such as Contort if necessary. Chasing a target that is actively running away usually means that the Athletics and Acrobatics checks are rolled vs. the targets Athletics or Acrobatics roll. Athletics is used when they jump in the water, climb a wall, or simply run. Acrobatics is used to resolve leaping over obstacles or winding through a hectic, busy environment, like a street market. When chasing an object, the rolls are made vs. a simple target. Pursuing a target represents a process that can take a very long time, perhaps weeks or months trekking across wilderness. The crucial distinction between pursuit and chase is that during a pursuit, the pursuers do not identify their targets precise location, and cannot catch them immediately. Each day, the pursuer and target perform an opposed roll. The skill used depends upon the action taken in the pursuit.

                This is the method in which a chase or pursuit is resolved.<br>
                1. Determine how far apart each party is. <br>
                2. Determine the amount of successful rolls must be made to catch up with the target.<br>
                3. Roll an opposed check using any skill or attribute determined appropriate for the chase/pursuit.<br>
                4. If the pursuer wins, they lower the number of successful rolls to catch the target by 1. If the one fleeing wins, increase
                that number by 1 instead.<br>
                5. Determine if the pursuer loses track of their target or catches up.<br>
                6. If they catch up, it becomes the chase is over, if they lose track, the chase is also over. If neither, return to step 3.
