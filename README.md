Welcome to my portfolio. I am a young aspiring technical writer who made this portfolio site to learn new and valuable skills as well as make a detailed and dedicated site to show off my skills.

My portfolio is built using the [Aries](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/template-aries-bootstrap-html/archive/master.zip) template, a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 4.0 template designed and developed by [WowThemes.Net](https://www.wowthemes.net/) and distributed by [Bootstrap Starter](https://bootstrapstarter.com/).

Please, look around and visit my website. If you have any ideas, please submit a ticket with any ideas.

If you want to contact me, email me at Abrown9@ucmerced.edu

Thank you!
